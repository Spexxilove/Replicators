A strategy multiplayer game implemented in java

This is a reupload of a university project from 2014.
The goal of the project was to implement a multiplayer game in java without any 3rd-party libraries.
The project was handeled by a group of 4.
The focus was on networking and general programming, not on design or art.

More information on the game and the project is provided in the Documents folder (german only)
The compiled game is provided as a jar file.
Disclaimer:
  It seems that the gui of the launcher does not display properly with newer java versions.

What I did for this project:
  -Network programming and design
  -Parts of gamplay programming
  -3d art (modelling and animation)
  -Parts of game design and conceptualisation.
